# Packaging Content Mapping Issue

## Description

This is a test project that demonstrates an issue with content mapping within packaging. The issue is that not all possible content mappings are being displayed across all the content mapping pages. This means that after an admin performs all the required mappings there are still unmapped items that the admin has no way of accessing and mapping. This can also be confusing if the admin doesn't notice this on the warnings page and thinks that they have mapped all the content.
